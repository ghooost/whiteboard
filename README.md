## Whiteboard attempt 0

Here is an attempt to create a simple and fast
whiteboard app to draw and share schemes.

That's a question - if it has sence to keep each figure as
a set of editable data at it's own layer.

Potentially it allows to change/move already created
shapes, but is it ok for a 'simple and fast' app?

React, Redux, Canvas
Node, WebSocket - will be added later.
